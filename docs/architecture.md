# Cluster Management Service Architecture Design

## Overview  
This document outlines the architecture for the Cluster Lifecycle Management Service.  
The Cluster Management Service will provide everything needed for creating and monitoring a 
Kubernetes cluster and configuring it post-bootstrap for a customer.  

## Components  

#### Cluster Management Service  
A microservice developed by the CrateKube team responsible for providing 
everything needed for creating and monitoring a Kubernetes cluster and configuring it post-bootstrap. 
For direct cluster creation RKE will be used and the state files generated by RKE must be persisted for later use in EBS.
For post MVP hosted cluster creation, such as AKS, EKS, or GKE, 
the Cluster Management Service will need to be deployed along side the Cloud Management Service.  

#### Kubernetes Cluster  
A Kubernetes cluster is a set of node machines for running containerized applications.

#### RKE
Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. 
RKE solves the problem of installation complexity, a common issue in the Kubernetes community.

#### Cloud Management Service  
A microservice developed by the CrateKube team responsible for provisioning and monitoring cloud resources and services.

#### Policy Management Service  
A microservice developed by the CrateKube team providing compliance validation 
for all infrastructure provisioned through platform services.

#### EBS  
Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high performance block storage service.
